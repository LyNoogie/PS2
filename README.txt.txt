For this assignment, I decided to follow closely to the previous implementation of the website, but used a couple Bootstrap methods that made formatting the webpage easier.

I wanted to clean up the professor's view of the learning objectives along with each evaluation metric, and to do so, I made them both dropdown texts so the viewer starts off with a clearn page with clearly defined learning objectives. The user then has the ability to expand on certain learning objectives and further look at each evaluation metric and good/bad homework submissions.

A log out button was placed at the top of the page with no current functionality along with a dropdown menu for a different way to navigate around to different viewer settings.
